    "\n",
    "> In this section, look to provide a high-level overview of the project in layman’s terms. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- _Has an overview of the project been provided, such as the problem domain, project origin, and related datasets or input data?_\n",
    "- _Has enough background information been given so that an uninformed reader would understand the problem domain and following problem statement?_\n",

    "Goal of this project is to build a proof of concept for social image description platform using deep learning. Users can upload an image that they would like to have described, the image is then surfaced in other users’ streams and one or more users describe it. Over time, the system learns associations between words used to describe an image and the visual features found in it, and gets better at predicting descriptions on its own. Additionally will be the platform also trained with currently available labeled images (for example Flickr8, Flickr30).\n",
    "\n",
    "For a human it takes very little time to recognize, categorize and correctly name an object from an image. For a computer this problem is much more complicated, because of the objects can be for example rotated, have different sizes, colors or can be partially hiding another object. Currently one of the most used technique for identifying objects from images is deep learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this project the author will try to broader his knowledge within this field and create an application that can be used in different fields. As an example below are some possible use-cases, where the application could be beneficial:\n",
    "* **Object description for blind people**: Blind person will hold a phone camera which will send facing image to the projects server, and say aloud objects that are in front of the person.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Translator**: User will take a picture of an object and the application will return name of the object in selected language (or several languages).\n"

    "> In this section, you will be expected to analyze the data you are using for the problem. This data can either be in the form of a dataset (or datasets), input data (or input files), or even an environment. The type of data should be thoroughly described and, if possible, have basic statistics and information presented (such as discussion of input features or defining characteristics about the input or environment). Any abnormalities or interesting qualities about the data that may need to be addressed have been identified (such as features that need to be transformed or the possibility of outliers).
